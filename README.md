# redux-sendbird-example
## WIP:
A small chatting application implemented using React Native and Redux. It uses the SendBird API to handle messaging. Still needs a fair amount of (work) debugging and styling improvement, but some of the basic functionality is covered.

## Running the application:
* Install [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content) 
* Clone this repository.
* From the repository's parent directory, run`cd redux-sendbird-example`.
* To run the app in an iOS simulator, run `react-native run-ios`
